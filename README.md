## Ultimate Freeplay Trainer
### About
- This is a Rocket League plugin that you can install on bakkesmod.com.
- Its goal is to provide unlimited customization to your freeplay keybinds.
- Originally, you can only use the pre-defined presets that either Rocket League or BakkesMod created.

### Credits:
- Made possible by CinderBlocc and ItsBrank's Rendering Tools: https://github.com/CinderBlocc/RenderingTools
  - Great base library for 3D overlay rendering in RL!
